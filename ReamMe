Hello,

As we began to close out this year I wanted to take a few moments to provide feedback on the value Jerome added to the completion of one of our largest initiative this year Complex letter migration. Jerome attributed value through analysis and creation of test plan for each of the 118 letters migrated. He verbally and in writing kept our team in the US abreast of his progress and any impediments. He demonstrated leadership by making suggestions for logical grouping in processing letters and impediment resolution. He also showed flexibility in working on different things when we experienced environment issues. It can be difficult to stay connected with teams working in different locations, but Jerome stayed for our Monday â€“ Thursday 9:45am est. stand-up to connect with the team providing detailed updates. A lot of the work (test suites) created for the migration project can now be used in our testing for migration from Content 1 to Chariot. His attention to detail and knowledge of letters has become an asset. I look forward to working with him more in the coming year!
